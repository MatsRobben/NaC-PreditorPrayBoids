# NaC-PreditorPrayBoids
This is the repository for the 2023-2024 Natural Computing course project

To do:
- Bug: (boundaries)
- Methods & introduction (adjust)
- Distance prey-predator (so predator can eat prey)
- Try some parameters (Could be a backup plan)
- Approach evolutionary algorithm (papers)
- Evolutionar algorithm 
- CMA-ES algorithm
- Possibly start with optimizing only a couple of parameters
- Makes plots of the search space and check if the same stratagies are found each time

Limitation: this global optimaization is not how nature works, but we could use it to find optimal stratagies. possibly compare with contiues evolution.
